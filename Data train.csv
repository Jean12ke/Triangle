Keewe is the fintech that engages your business in the ecological transition through your banking operations!
With as a bonus, the 1st foreign exchange platform that acts for the planet ?? ??

?? Keewe, how did it come about?
We came up with the idea of Keewe when we realized that VSE-SMEs are both the companies that are the least supported in their ecological transition and those that pay the most for their banking services ??¡â???

?? What we're doing?
We totally rethought the banking model! With us, every transaction a company makes generates green cashback for them that they can use to fund their transition ??

How? With each banking transaction, Keewe gives back to its customers a part of its margin to allow them to measure, reduce and offset their C02 emissions! ??
 
??¡á? Who is Keewe for?

? For SMBs who want to use flexible, intuitive and affordable banking services ??
? For SMBs who want to capture market share, stay ahead of regulations, attract customers & talent and save money while committing to the planet ??

At the same time, the funds under management seek attractive returns for subscribers in order to remunerate their risk. This combination is symbolized in the 3Ps of their name, meaning People Planet Profit.

IMPACT AT TWO LEVELS
The companies in which ALTER EQUITY3P II invests are characterized by
- their activity: their products or services respond to a major social or environmental issue. In practice, these activities overlap with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (""SDGs""); and
- their management practices: they are committed to progress in terms of social and environmental responsibility in the conduct of their business through the implementation of a dedicated action plan, called the Extra-Financial Business Plan (EFBP).

The second fund raised, ALTER EQUITY3P II, is particularly ambitious in terms of impact, in line with the results of the previous fund:
- 1.6 million tons of CO2 have been avoided since the equity investments were acquired through their activity. By comparison, France's annual emissions amount to 450 million tons;
- 92% of Fund I's holdings have complied with the BPEF objectives by more than 90%; and
- 1/3 of the companies in which the Fund has invested are run by women, which we also believe is a record among French investment funds.

Why do we do this? Because we want to break down the codified and fixed barriers of the wine world.

What we do on a daily basis? We make wine more human: by highlighting those who are at its origin and by making it accessible to all. Wine is alive, it is made to be tasted with one's taste buds, one's desires, one's feelings, not with technical notions.
All this with one goal: that everyone changes his or her relationship with wine, and takes more and more pleasure in savoring it as an enlightened consumer.

For this, all our actions are carried out in a relaxed manner with passion,
conviviality (this is not a wine word) and audacity!

On the market, the range of carbon assessment tools is complex, opaque and often misleading. GCI makes it accessible to the greatest number of entrepreneurs, at a lower cost, to manage their complete and certified carbon footprint. GCI has more than 2,000 clients and has the trust of the most rigorous SMEs and large companies on the subject of environmental footprinting: Derichebourg, ASO, Enerlis, FIA, Mane, LCL.

The GreenTech GCI solution allows you to carry out an accurate carbon footprint on scopes 1, 2 and 3, in total autonomy, and also allows entrepreneurs who wish to be accompanied to call on the advice of 90 GCI experts in the field.

In an economy disrupted by climate change, the GCI platform allows companies to initiate, in a collaborative and transparent manner, the sustainable growth of their ecoresponsible destiny.

 We are also convinced that happy cleaners create a virtuous circle, resulting in a better quality of service and a significant decrease in turnover, and that social and environmental responsibility is a factor of choice today and for tomorrow.

At Cleany, we rehabilitate the cleaning profession. We create the conditions so that our Cleaners are proud to do their job, because they know that it is essential, that they have differentiating skills and that by working at Cleany they will be respected.

We do our job with an eye for detail, with ecological products and always in a good mood.

We want to give the front lines their visibility and pride in their mission, to fully integrate the Cleaners into the life of the companies in which they work, because this benefits both the Cleaners and the client companies.

We wish to improve and perpetuate the working conditions of the Cleaners, in a measurable and sustainable way and to do everything possible to measure and reduce the environmental impact of Cleany.

Today, Cleany has 7 years of experience, 330 Cleaners and nearly 475 clients in Paris and the Ile-de-France region.",N. Administrative and support service activities,81 - Building and Landscape Services,8121Z,,13.08

We have an approach that allows us to understand the needs of Internet users.
Our motto: If Internet users are satisfied with the recommendations made by the site, once they are insured, they will become more loyal to our insurance partners.

We therefore go beyond the role of comparator to become a real online advisor by prescribing the best insurance offer (at the most competitive price) according to the real needs of the insured.

A better understanding of policyholders' needs and expectations
Improved understanding of the policyholder's needs and expectations regarding insurance offers
A time saving in the contracting process.
Better satisfaction in the insurance/policyholder relationship

For each insurance product, the HyperAssur site offers diagnostic tools adapted to allow the greatest number of people to understand their own insurance needs.

If HyperAssur.com allows consumers to find the most suitable offers, it allows insurers to have more qualified prospects, and thus help them better adapt their offers and maximize their sales.

While the energy transition is a topic that is gaining momentum in the public debate, the choice of one's own energy remains obscure. ekWateur is the desire to make energy, specifically renewable energy, transparent and to give citizens the choice, through an agile and innovative structure.

We are a start-up of 100 highly motivated geeks who love renewable energies and are united around the following values
- Combativeness: inventing new models and new offers to reconcile viability and today's challenges.
- Sustainability: never lose sight of the energy transition.
- Proximity: our customers are our friends <3
- Transparency: education, accuracy and traceability are our watchwords

Our goal is to make the choice of energy accessible, simple and transparent. Our actions aim to ensure that everyone has their own energy transition at the end of their click.

100% renewable energy is our foundation. Our electricity and gas are certified by guarantees of origin, and our wood comes from French sawmill residues, with wood from eco-managed forests.
On this basis, we have developed all our services using the latest development technologies, and in collaboration with our group of volunteer and passionate beta-testers.

In just over 5 years, we have acquired 300,000 meters, both private and professional, throughout France. ekWateur is the 5th largest energy supplier and the first 100% renewable and independent energy supplier.","D.

We founded the startup Besight in July 2016. Our first ambition was to co-create fashion clothes and accessories in collaboration with a community of young French designers.
 
As we developed, we stayed in tune with our customers. Thus, in June 2018, we decided to reorient our positioning and capitalize more on the talent of our designers.
 
With our growing community of designers, we offered companies a platform to co-create goodies, an innovative way to engage their customers or employees.
 
On our platform, we organize, at the request of companies, contests in order to propose to their customers or collaborators to vote for the best design of goodies, guaranteed 100% ethical, responsible and sustainable.
 
After two years of existence, Besight was really born in early 2019. Today, we make it possible to find original ideas for media objects in less than 5 minutes.

Our mission at Hublo is to invent digital tools that simplify the daily life of healthcare professionals, so that they too can focus on their mission: caring for patients.

To pursue this ambitious mission, we have just raised 22 million euros to :

- support the technical development of our tool and meet the growing expectations of healthcare institutions
- launch Hublo in 4 new European countries over the next 18 months, and become the leader in HR management for healthcare institutions in Europe
- continue to support the 2,800 healthcare institutions that already trust us and take care of our 400,000 users
- recruit, by the end of 2023, 200 talents in all departments of the company: technical and product development, sales, project management, data, finance, HR, marketing...!
